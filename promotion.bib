  school = {Brandenburgische Technische Universität Cottbus},
  year = {2003},
  month = {september},
  note = {280 pages, 31MB PDF},
  abstract = {The approximation of transient detonation
	 waves requires numerical methods that are able to resolve a wide
	 range of different scales. Especially the accurate consideration
	 of detailed chemical kinetics is extremely demanding. This thesis
	 describes an efficient solution strategy for the Euler equations of gas
	 dynamics for mixtures of thermally perfect species with detailed,
	 non-equilibrium reaction that tackles the problem of source term
	 stiffness by temporal and spatial dynamic mesh adaptation. All gas
	 dynamically relevant scales are sufficiently resolved. The blockstructured
	 adaptive mesh refinement technique of Berger and Colella is utilized to
	 supply the required resolution locally on the basis of hydrodynamic
	 refinement criteria. This adaptive method is tailored especially for
	 time-explicit finite volume schemes and uses a hierarchy of spatially refined
	 subgrids which are integrated recursively with reduced time steps. A
	 parallelization strategy for distributed memory machines is developed and
	 implemented. It follows a rigorous domain decomposition approach
	 and partitions the entire grid hierarchy. A time-operator splitting
	 technique is employed to decouple hydrodynamic transport and chemical
	 reaction. It allows the separate numerical integration of the homogeneous
	 Euler equations with time-explicit finite volume methods and the
	 usage of an time-implicit discretization only for the stiff reaction
	 terms. High-resolution shock capturing schemes are constructed for the
	 homogeneous Euler equations with complex equation of state. In particular,
	 a reliable hybrid Roe-solver-based method is derived. The scheme
	 avoids unphysical values due to the Roe linearization and utilizes
	 additional numerical viscosity to stabilize the approximation of strong
	 shocks that inherently appear at the head of detonation waves. In
	 different test configurations it is shown that this hybrid Roe-type
	 method is superior for detonation simulation to any other method
	 considered. Large-scale simulations of unstable detonation structures of
	 hydrogen-oxygen detonations run on recent Beowulf clusters demonstrate the
	 efficiency of the entire approach. In particular, computations of
	 regular cellular structures in two and three space dimensions and their

	 Jeans' 'derivation' of his result has become known by the (in)famous
	 sobriquet ''the Jeans swindle.'' The present paper rectifies the
	 situation by giving just such a mathematically clean derivation of
	 Jeans' dispersion relation, via a static universe with cosmological
	 constant. The derivation not merely vindicates Jeans' analysis, it also
	 produces proper nonlinear evolution equations which allow one to
	 study the evolution beyond the linear regime studied by Jeans.</P>},

	 enjoys the questionable reputation that it cannot be derived in a
	 mathematically clean manner-as a matter of principle. For that reason
	 Jeans' 'derivation' of his result has become known by the (in)famous
	 sobriquet ''the Jeans swindle.'' The present paper rectifies the
	 situation by giving just such a mathematically clean derivation of
	 Jeans' dispersion relation, via a static universe with cosmological
	 constant. The derivation not merely vindicates Jeans' analysis, it also
	 produces proper nonlinear evolution equations which allow one to
	 study the evolution beyond the linear regime studied by Jeans.</P>},

  abstract = {The effect of compressibility on the structure of turbulence is an important, but
	 difficult, topic in turbulence modeling. Modeling issues in production,
	 dissipation and transport of turbulent kinetic energy need to be
	 addressed to account for Mach number effects. In the present review, the
	 compressibility effect is investigated in the context of engineering models
	 needed for complex flow computations, particularly the k-$\epsilon$ 
	 model. Issues such as the dissipative nature of compressibility, the
	 complexities arising due to the non-divergent nature of the velocity field,
	 added time-scale effect due to a non-equilibrium between the rates of
	 production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy, the enthalpic
	 production term and the term representing the baroclinic effect, have
	 been discussed to facilitate the inclusion of these terms in the
	 solution of compressible turbulent flow fields. Flows characterized by
	 strong streamline curvature and inhomogeneities arising due to strong
	 shocks and rapid expansions, in the form of supersonic flow past an
	 axi-symmetric afterbody and hypersonic flow past a projectile, have been
	 adopted to facilitate computational assessment of these aspects.},
